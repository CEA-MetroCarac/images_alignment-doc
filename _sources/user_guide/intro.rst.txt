Introduction
============

**Images_Alignment** is an application dedicated to ease the images alignment using affine transformation matrices calculated either from the `pyStackReg <https://github.com/glichtner/pystackreg)>`_ or `SIFT <https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/features_detection/plot_sift.html>`_ algorithm, a combined approach, or from a user driven approach (specifying manually the matching points).

**This documentation mainly focuses on using the application in GUI mode.**

For scripting mode usage, please refer to the final section of this documentation.

The application's GUI consists of 4 main panels, described in the following pages.

Panel **1** is dedicated to the processing features, while Panels **2**, **3**, and **4** are dedicated to visualization.
